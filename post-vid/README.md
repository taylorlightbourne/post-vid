## User story:
As a user, I want to find events geared towards my interests. If I am searching for a food festival, I would like to be able to search that and see food festivals around the world.

## Project Timeline:
* Start: Monday, June 7th, 2021.
* Presentation: Friday, June 11th, 2021.

---

### Front-end:
* HTML 
* CSS (Starter code provided by: Brian Design https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s&t=2450s)
* JavaScript
* React 
* Redux
* Media queries
* API fetched from Ticketmaster

---


### Successes:

* The mobile responsiveness is working smoothly. My favorite feature is the hamburger menu being able to open and close on screens smaller than 960px. 
* I was able to use the css from the cards on the home page, to the fetched Ticketmaster data and to the favorites page. 
* Once the user adds an event to favs, the "add to favs" button will change to "delete from favs" to prevent multiple of the same event in the favorites cart.
---

### Future Additions:

* Would like for images to appear on the single events page.
* Would like to add the feature to go to the previous page without having to retype the keyword entered.
* Would like for the error page to also appear when no events match the keyword entered.
